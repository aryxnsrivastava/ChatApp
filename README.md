Check Terminal ChatApp.png for a better understanding of what's going on. In the Image, top right one is the server window and the rest are clients

Initialize Your server first and then the clients.
Pull the code and run it on terminal by typing "python client.py" for initalizing a user/client and typing "python server.py" for server.
You can have as many clients you want.

Once you send a message from one user window, all the other clients recieve it in real time.
